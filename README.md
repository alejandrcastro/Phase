# Phase
A GUI for creating and displaying phase masks for a Liquid Crystal on Silicon (LCoS) Spatial Light Modulator (SLM)

## Features
* Can load a multiple image files from a text file or a Hamamatsu .lst file
* Phase maks can be modified with Zernike functions (e.g. astigmatism, coma, lens...)
* A bounding box can be selected so the Zernike function is applied only to that area
* Modified masks can be saved for later use or use in other software
* The phase function can be displayed on a second monitor to display on the SLM (Windows Only)
